  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 6, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application <strong>Barcode Beasts</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “us”) handles information. The App requests access to your device’s <strong>Camera</strong> in order to scan barcodes/QR codes and capture live images for on-device processing.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The camera is used <strong>only</strong> to scan barcodes and analyze images within the App.</li>
      <li>Images and video frames are processed <strong>on your device</strong>. We do not collect, store, or transmit your camera content to our servers.</li>
      <li>No personal data is sold or shared with third parties for advertising.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <p><strong>Camera</strong> (<code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>): We access your camera to enable barcode scanning and image-based features. The live camera feed is analyzed on-device. We do not persist the raw camera feed and do not upload it to any server.</p>

  <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
  <p>The App may use on-device machine learning (for example, Google’s ML Kit Barcode Scanning) to decode barcodes or perform image understanding. Processing occurs locally on your device. We do not receive your images or scan results unless you intentionally share or export them.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, or contact details through normal use of the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> The App currently does not send analytics events. If we add analytics in the future, we will update this Policy and the Google Play Data Safety section accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> The App does not display personalized ads and does not share data with advertisers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may include third‑party libraries necessary for core functionality (e.g., Google ML Kit). These libraries typically perform processing on-device. Please refer to their respective privacy documentation for more details.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not store raw camera images or video. If you save an item or result inside the App, it is stored locally on your device and remains under your control. Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can grant or revoke Camera permission at any time in your device settings. Some features will not work without camera access.</li>
    <li>You may clear in‑app saved data via the App’s settings or by uninstalling the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Users</h2>
  <p>Your data is processed locally on your device. We do not maintain servers that receive your camera data.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. We will update the “Last updated” date above and publish the revised Policy at this URL.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Policy or our privacy practices, contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@barcodebeasts.app">support@barcodebeasts.app</a>.</p>
